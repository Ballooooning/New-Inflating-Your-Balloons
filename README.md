   ## What is the Dynamic Balloon NFT?
   The Ballooooning token has evolved from a standard ERC20 token named Balloon (old contract address:0xf2EcDc4559d62E20b1a7F5FFF5C353f0CD3331C4 https://ftmscan.com/token/0xf2ecdc4559d62e20b1a7f5fff5c353f0cd3331c4) into a combination of an ERC20 token named Air and a Balloon NFT that is automatically sent to the wallet that purchased the Air tokens. However, once you purchase the Air tokens they are not transferred in one lump sum, instead they are automatically streamed at a rate of 1 Air token per second to your wallet until you receive all of your purchased amount, which ends your current stream. At any point you can update your stream and purchase more Air tokens, sell them, or even transfer them to someone else.  If you transfer your Balloon to another address (that doesn't already have a Balloon), your stream will automatically cancel and the metadata on the NFT will be unchanged (not reset to the first image) after the transfer.

   When you purchase Air tokens for the first time, you will automatically receive a dynamic Balloon NFT that updates the NFTs metadata making it change colors every second during your stream and then grow in size depending on the amount of Air tokens in your wallet. You can only receive one dynamic NFT at a time per wallet, so if you sell your Air tokens or transfer your NFT, make sure your Air token balance is zero if you want to purchase more Air tokens down the road and receive a new NFT, otherwise having a very small amount of Air tokens (token dust) in your wallet could prevent you from receiving a new NFT if you purchase more Air tokens later on. 

  After you first purchase Air tokens, your dynamic balloon will start at the first stage which is when your wallet has a balance between 0 and 260 Air tokens.
  
  For example, There will be 5 "stages" of your balloon NFT that will increase in size at each stage as you stream more Air into your NFT balloon according to the illustration below: 

 ##  The 5 stages depend on the balance of Air tokens in your wallet:
   
Stage 0 is between 0 and 260 Air tokens and the balloon will be this size and will change color during your stream every second with each new token sent to your wallet.

Stage 1 is between 260 - 15,600 Air tokens and the balloon will be this size and will change color during your stream every second with each new token sent to your wallet.

## What is Superfluid

Moving tokens between accounts is usually pretty boring. It's typically done through basic ERC20 transfers. Say I transfer you 100 DAI - this causes my balance to go down by 100 and yours to go up by 100. 

Superfluid's smart contract framework takes this a step forward by introducing a new token standard, called the **Super Token**. 

The Super Token extends the basic ERC20 transfer functionality to include Super Agreements. These Super Agreements give us new and more powerful ways to move tokens on-chain!

The Constant Flow Agreement (CFA) is the most popular Super Agreement and lets us *stream* our Super Tokens. What does streaming even mean?

Streaming refers to the by-the-second movement of tokens between accounts. Imagine Alice is streaming to Bob at a flow rate of 1 DAIx/second. This means that with every passing second, Alice's balance is increasing by 1 DAI and Bob's is decreasing.

## Flower NFTs (non-technical overview)

Interacting with the [Flower NFT Contract](./contracts/Flower.sol) is simple - you start by creating a stream of `acceptedToken` to the Flower contract.

The Flower contract reacts and mints a Flower NFT to your address. As your stream goes on, the metadata of the Flower NFT will graduate images as the amount you've streamed so far into the contract increases. You can increase/decrease your flow rate or delete your stream as you please!

Addresses can only have one Flower NFT at once. If you transfer your Flower to another address (that doesn't already have a Flower), you will have your `acceptedToken` stream automatically cancelled if you haven't already done so. The metadata on the NFT will be unchanged (not reset to the first image) after the transfer.

## Try it out live on Goerli Testnet ðŸŽ¬

1. Clone the repo and build with `npm install`
2. Create a `.env` file and fill out the suggested variables from `.env.template`
   - Make sure the wallet you're providing a private key for has some Goerli ETH in it. This wallet will be receiving the Flower NFT!
3. Mint some WATERx Super Tokens with `npx hardhat run scripts/mintSuperWater.js --network goerli`
4. Stream the WATERx Super Tokens to the Flower contract with `npx hardhat run scripts/streamWater.js --network goerli`
5. Go to [Opensea's Testnet App](https://testnets.opensea.io/) and search your address.
   - You should see an "Evolving Flower NFT". That's it! You are now watering the NFT. Note down its token ID
6. After 5 minutes, go to [this NFT Viewer](https://www.nftviewer.xyz/), click into the "Smart Contract" page. Then, enter the contract address `0xEbEf99eE03571a5957E5d6ee4061940c760b0515` and your token ID.

You'll see the NFT image has changed to show a more grown up flower! If you wait another 5 minutes, you'll see it grows again.
